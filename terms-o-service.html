                    To commission me, you can contact me through one of my profiles linked in
                    <a href="https://churrroanimations.github.io/churros-commissions/contact-me" class="subsecTextLink">Contact Me</a>.
                    Provide any references and details relating to what you want me to draw.
                    I will tell you the price and when I'll be available to start.
                </p>
                <p class="subsectionText">
                    I will try my best to not ghost you, and I expect you to do the same.
                    After a month, and I havent responded to your messages in the past 7 days, you can request a full refund.
                    After two months, if neither one of us have communicated, you can request a half refund.
                    However, I will not be offering any refunds after you have received the commission.
                </p>
                <p class="subsectionText">
                    I am willing to draw just about anything, though I will require more details about what you are wanting me to draw.
                    I also do YCH's (See
                    <a href="https://churrroanimations.github.io/churros-commissions/commission-sheets"  class="subsecTextLink">Commission Sheets</a>).

                            No NSFW/explicit content, material, or discussion.
                            To paraphrase someone else's Carrd, nothing that would make your grandmother sigh and pray for your salvation.
                            I will not draw any content of this nature and I dont wish to receive content of this nature.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Try to use proper English grammar, complete sentences, and text etiquette. 
                            I understand English is not your native language, just try your best.
                            Limit the use of brain rot and slang terms.
                            I will follow suit.

                            Don't act like it's a complete joke.
                            I'm not asking you to be uptight or extremely seriously, I'm just asking you to contain yourself.
